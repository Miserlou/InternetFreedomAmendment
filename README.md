# The Internet Freedom Amendment

## v0.1.0

### About

The goal of this repo is to create the desired language, points and criteria for a United States Constitution amendment that provides unrestricted freedom of access to the internet. This is envisioned to include:

1. The right to access any web site, anywhere, any time without restriction should the provider of the information, e.g. a web site owner, choose to provide it publicly
2. The inability of the government to remove access to information that is publicly accessible for any political or economic reason

### How This Works

I made this as a git repo simply because it seems like the most elegant and simple way to create a living document that at times will have many different moving parts. You may fork this repo and make changes you see to the documents contained inside. Changes proposed will be considered and if needed integrated into the core document. Ideally, I'd like to see people discuss various ways to not only implement the core goals above, but also help come up with even clearer goals that ensure the continued freedom we have come to take for granted.

### Who The Hell I Am

I'm just an entrepreneur that loves to make things. I'm hosting the repo for now to see if enough people want to partake in this - if people do, I'll make and fund an organization on GitHub to hold the repo and will let the community take this the direction it needs to go.

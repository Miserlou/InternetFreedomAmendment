The right of people to be secure in their expression, communication and use of the internet and other mediums of online interaction, commerce, engagement and activity shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable criminal cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the offense, reason and validity, with ability to challenge or respond prior to accusation.

The right of people to engage in expression through linking, discussion and other methods of communicating information via the internet shall not be violated on US soil or any other nation.

No party shall have the right to compel another to remove information, data or other items from a web site, service, game, application or other online or software medium without clearly proving the right of ownership beyond doubt.
